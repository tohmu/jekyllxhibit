## Short time experiments

Joseph and I went looking for readymade objects people had thrown out near my studio in K Road.

I didn't have a lot of free time that day, so we made quick arrangements in the studio with the objects that we'd picked up, as well as objects Joseph had picked up from Lynfield (where he lives).
